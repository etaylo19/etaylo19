👋 Hi, I’m @etaylo19. I've been using data analysis and visualization in my research portfolio for a number of years. I was weaned on R but am steadily 
advancing my Python skills. I find data science exciting and began my part-time study in 2010. In 2016, I earned my MS in business analytics from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Since then I've made steady progress on my skills as evidenced by some of the repos on this platform. However, there is always something new to learn.

👀 As a continuous learner, I’m very much interested in taking my skills to the next level. I've leveraged the LinkedIn platform to advance my skills in R, Python, SQL Server, Microsoft Sequel Server Management Studio, and Transact Sequel but desire additional opportunities to practice and hone my craft.

🌱 I’m currently learning more about the GitHub platform to be better able to collaborate with and learn from others in the data science community. In
addition, I want to improve my skills in Visual Studio Code to become more productive.

💞️ My current position does not provide all the growth opportunities in data science that I would prefer. Therefore, I am seeking part-time opportunities that facilitate my continued growth in the data analysis world.

📫 If anything in my profile is of interest to you or your organization, please reach out to me at etaylo19@gmail.com.
Thanks.
